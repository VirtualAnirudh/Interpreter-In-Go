## Interpreter In Go

I love programming but I dropped it a few years ago in favor of other projects. I've been out of touch since then.
But I want to get back into it again and decided to pick it up again.

As I was searching for good projects to build, I stumbled upon an interesting book - [Writing An Interpreter In Go](https://interpreterbook.com/) by Thorsten Ball. 

I'm going into the project blind. I've never written any Go code but I've heard that it is not that hard to learn. 

## The Goal

The goal of this project is to learn Go, learn how interpreters work  and have fun while doing it.


## Notes

You can find all the notes I take [here](Notes.md)
